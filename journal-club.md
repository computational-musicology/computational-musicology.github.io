## Join the meetings

The Journal Clubs are monthly online meetings in which we discuss a recent paper relevant to the field of Computational Musicology. The meetings are supposed to not last longer than 2 hours. 

You can join our monthly journal clubs here: [https://epfl.zoom.us/j/300517233](https://epfl.zoom.us/j/300517233). 

The next meeting date is **Friday, December 20th, 2019, 4pm BST, 5pm CEST**.

The paper to be discussed is shown at the top of the list below. If you want to participate in further discussions on Computational Musicology, 
feel free to join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/computational-musicology).
