## Join the meetings

The Journal Clubs are monthly online meetings in which we discuss a recent paper relevant to the field of Computational Musicology. The meetings are supposed to not last longer than 2 hours. 

You can join our monthly journal clubs here: [https://epfl.zoom.us/j/300517233](https://epfl.zoom.us/j/300517233). 
The next date is **Thursday June 27th, 2019, 4pm BST, 5pm CET**,
where we will discuss 'Annotator subjectivity in harmony annotations of popular music' 
by Koops et al. (2019).
If you want to participate in further discussions on Computational Musicology, 
feel free to join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/computational-musicology).
